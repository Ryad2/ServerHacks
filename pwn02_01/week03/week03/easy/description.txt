In this challenge, you need to answer a question about firewalls.

The Topology

Alice -
       `-- eth0:firewall:eth1 --- INET
Bob ---Â´

Alice = 192.168.0.92
Bob = 192.168.0.148

firewall:eth0 = 192.168.0.213
firewall:eth1 = 131.159.12.91

The Question

The firewall is tracking states with a list of IP-5 tuples.
It always stores the initiating packet and allows answer packets.
That means, the IP-5 tuple is only stored once, but it matches traffic in both directions.

For new connections, the list is appended (new IP-5 tuple added to the back).

The firewall starts with the following state:

[("192.168.0.92", "8.8.8.8", "udp", 20474, 53), ("192.168.0.92", "31.192.117.132", "tcp", 49722, 80)]

You should first reproduce how this state might have been established:
1) Alice did a DNS lookup (using the google DNS server) for a certain domain.
   She got the answer 31.192.117.132.
2) Alice is surfing this website (probably seven clicks and streaming a video for 8 minutes).

Your task is to calculate the final state after the following packets have been
sent through the firewall:

* A tcp packet from the internet from 123.123.123.123 to Alice, src port 20474, dst port 22.
* A late, duplicate DNS reply for alice from 8.8.8.8, udp, src port 53, dst port 20474.
* Alice trying to establish a telnet connection (tcp, port 23) with source port 6666 to 145.145.99.99.
* Carl (61.61.61.61) trying to establish a telnet connection (using src port 55553)  with Bob.
* Bob, spoofing Alice's IP, sending out a smtp packet (using src port 46465) to 54.54.54.54.
* Bob, spoofing Alice's IP, sending out a telnet packet (using src port 38453) to 8.8.8.8.
* Bob, sending out a telnet packet (using src port 23, dst port 55553) to 61.61.61.61.
* Alice getting more HTTP packets from the website she visited initially.


Please put the solution in one line. We use ast.literal_eval to parse it.
